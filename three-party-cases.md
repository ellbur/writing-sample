title: Three-Party Windfall Cases

# Introduction 

Consider the following facts:

> A music group (Group) contracts with a venue (Venue) to rent space for a show. Venue separately contracts with Electrician to inspect the venue’s existing wiring the day before the show. Group’s contract with Venue contains a limitation-on-liability clause limiting Venue’s liability to return of rent paid; the Venue-Electrician contract contains no limitation. Although Electrician certifies the wiring as compliant, the following night a fault is discovered, forcing Group to cancel the show and lose sales in excess of its rent payments to Venue.

What are Group’s rights against Electrician? Does Group have a tort claim for negligent misrepresentation, based on Electrician’s certification that the wiring was compliant? Could the economic loss rule preclude such an action even if the elements of the tort are otherwise met?

## Negligent Misrepresentation

To make out a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must establish: “(1) the defendant had a pecuniary duty to provide accurate information, (2) the defendant supplied false information, (3) the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating the information, and (4) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss caused by justifiable reliance upon the false information.” *PR Acquisitions, LLC v. Midland Funding LLC*, C.A. No. 2017-0465-TMR, 2018 WL 2041521, at *13 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2018).

Group easily satisfies the first three elements but may struggle to show reliance and loss. As to reliance, while a jury could readily accept that Group would not have booked the venue had it been aware of electrical problems, Group may lack evidence that Electrician’s certification was significant in light of direct assurance’s from Venue and Venue’s reputation in the business. The difficulty is heightened if Group received Electrician’s certification only indirectly. Similarly, Electrician will argue that Group’s lost sales flowed from the inadequacy of the venue itself and could not have been avoided by an inspection one day prior.

The next hurdle for Group is the lack of direct relationship between it and Electrician. While the Delaware Supreme Court has not spoken on the issue, the Superior Court has persuasively reasoned that direct privity is not a requirement in all negligent misrepresentation cases. *See* *Guardian Construction Co. v. Tetra Tech Richardson, Inc.*, 583 A.2d 1378, 1386 (Del. Super. Ct. 1990). In *Guardian Construction*, the ??? had ???. Following *Guardian Construction*’s reasoning, “indirect” claims for negligent misrepresentation have been allowed by a ??? against a ??? and by a ??? against a ???. Against these precedents, Electrician likely cannot defend merely on the ground that it and Group were not in privity.

But the lack of a privity requirement may not be enough for Group, because a plaintiff claiming negligent misrepresentation must still establish a duty of care, *see* ???, and here the indirect relationship between Group and Electrician is again problematic. Electrician will argue that its inspection was solely for Venue’s benefit, to assist Venue in satisfying *its* contractual obligations to Group. Electrician’s argument is supported by the fact that Group and Venue negotiated an allocation of risk for defects in the performance space, but Group undertook no similar negotiation with Electrician—nor indeed any communication with Group at all before the matter turned to litigation. Group may struggle to convince a court to protect its interest in the performance space through imposition of a duty different than the contractual duty owed by Venue.
