# Facts

Group contracts with Venue to rent space for a show. Venue separately contracts with Electrician to inspect electrical wiring. Group’s contract with Venue contains a limitation-on-liability clause limiting Venue’s liability to return of rent paid; the Venue-Electrician contract contains no limitation. Although Electrician certifies the wiring as compliant, a fault is later discovered, forcing Group to cancel the show and lose sales in excess of rent payments.

What are Group’s rights against Electrician?

## Negligent Misrepresentation

To make out a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must establish: “(1) the defendant had a pecuniary duty to provide accurate information, (2) the defendant supplied false information, (3) the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating the information, and (4) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss caused by justifiable reliance upon the false information.” *PR Acquisitions, LLC v. Midland Funding LLC*, C.A. No. 2017-0465-TMR, 2018 WL 2041521, at *13 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2018).

Falsity and lack of due care are satisfied. The challenge for duty and reliance is the indirect relationship between Group and Electrician. It is clear that Electrician owed a pecuniary duty to *someone*. Privity is not required in all negligent misrepresentation cases. *See* *Guardian Construction Co. v. Tetra Tech Richardson, Inc.*, 583 A.2d 1378, 1386 (Del. Super. Ct. 1990). In *Guardian Construction*, the ??? had ???. Following *Guardian Construction*’s reasoning, “indirect” claims for negligent misrepresentation have been allowed by a ??? against a ??? and by a ??? against a ???.

But the lack of a privity requirement does not imply that a duty is owed to all indirect consumers. Electrician’s inspection was for Venue’s benefit, to assist Venue in satisfying its own contractual obligations to Group. The Group–Venue and Venue–Electrician contracts support that conclusion, both because there was no Group–Electrician contract and because Group and Electrician allocated the risk of defects among themselves with no allocation to Electrician.

Reliance fails for the same reason. While Group would not have booked the venue had it been aware of electrical problems, Group relied on Venue's assurances, not Electrician’s. The strength of Venue’s assurances may have been amplified by factors over which Electrician had no control, such as Venue’s reputation in the business.

In summary, while the state of the law is uncertain, the better view is that Group has no negligent misrepresentation claim against Electrician in these circumstances.

## Economic Loss Rule

Assuming the elements of negligent misrepresentation are otherwise satisfied, the question becomes whether the claim is nevertheless precluded by the “economic loss rule.”

The economic loss rule ....

The cases are unclear as to whether the economic loss rule acts to preclude an otherwise valid tort claim or whether it is a consideration in deciding whether to impose a tort duty in the first place. If the latter, the satisfaction of the elements of negligent misrepresentation would seem to imply, almost tautologically, that the economic loss rule does not preclude the claim. If the former, it is necessary to separately analyze the economic loss rule to determine whether it presents a barrier.

The economic loss rule typically does not apply to claims against professionals with pecuniary interests in the transaction. ???. That includes Electrician here. Thus, to the extent there is a valid claim for negligent misrepresentation, it is not precluded by the economic loss rule.

## Effect of Limitation on Liability

The final issue is whether Electrician could invoke the limitation on liability in the Group–Venue contract.

A decision either way would work a windfall to one party. If Group prevails, it is excused from the limitation it negotiated with Venue by the fortuity that the fault could be traced to a contract rather than one of Venue’s employees. If Electrician prevails, it receives a protection from liability it neither negotiated nor paid for. (The existence of either windfall helps explain why the tort of negligent misrepresentation should not extend to such indirect suits in the first place, as it undermines the parties’ ability to allocate risk by contract.)

The cases ???

In the absence of contrary authority, the better view is that the contract should be enforced as written. Because the limitation on liability by its terms applies only to suits by Group against Venue, it is inapplicable in a suit by Group against Electrician.

# Conclusion

The law is unclear, but Group likely cannot satisfy the duty and reliance elements of a claim for negligent misrepresentation. To the extent those elements may be satisfied, the economic loss rule and contractual limitation on liability are inapplicable.
