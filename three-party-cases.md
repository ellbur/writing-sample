title: Three-Party Windfall Cases

#Introduction 

Consider the following facts:

> A music group (Group) contracts with a venue (Venue) to rent space for a show. Venue separately contracts with Electrician to inspect the venue’s existing wiring the day before the show. Group’s contract with Venue contains a limitation-on-liability clause limiting Venue’s liability to return of the rent; the Venue-Electrician contract contains no such limitation. Although Electrician certifies the wiring as compliant, the following night a fault is discovered, forcing Group to cancel the show and lose sales in excess of its rent payments to Venue.

What are Group’s rights against Electrician? Does Group have a tort claim for negligent misrepresentation, based on Electrician’s certification that the wiring was compliant? Could the economic loss rule preclude such an action even if the elements of the tort are otherwise met?
