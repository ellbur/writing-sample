\vspace{12pt}\section{Introduction}

Statements about statements (``higher-order statements'') have long bothered
logicians, \textit{see} W.V.~Quine, \textit{Philosophy of Logic} 66--68 (2d
ed.~1986), so it is not surprising that they would make trouble for judges as
well. But law-about-law is not just a theoretical curiosity. Everyday examples
include: Was law X \emph{clearly established}? Did lawyer Y \emph{misrepresent}
law X? Would court Z have \emph{accepted} law X had the issue been raised?
Untangling these questions matters to judges who must decide whether to submit
such ``legal facts'' to juries. And, as shown below, the way law ``talks about
law'' can affect the substance of legal rights.

This essay surveys how courts deal with law-about-law in three discrete and
seemingly unrelated areas. The purpose is to demonstrate that all three are
variations of the same underlying theme---namely, how law talks about itself.


\section{Discussion}

Three examples of law-about-law are discussed below: legal malpractice,
liability insurance, and the ``reverse-payment'' antitrust claim recognized
in \textit{FTC v.~Actavis}, 570 U.S.~136 (2013).


\subsection{Legal Malpractice}

In a legal malpractice case arising out of litigation, the former client
accuses the lawyer of having litigated the case incorrectly. To prove
causation, the plaintiff must show that, had the lawyer acted correctly, the
outcome would have been more favorable. \textit{Bozelko v.~Papastavros}, 147
A.3d 1023, 1029 (Conn.~2016). The causation element is therefore law-about-law:
how would another court have behaved differently if presented with the correct
litigation strategy? \textit{See} \textit{id.}

This law-about-law element creates several issues. The first is whether a judge
or jury should decide it. If the question is how a prior factfinder (judge or
jury) would have acted on different evidence, there is general agreement to
send that question to a jury. \textit{Chocktoot v.~Smith}, 571 P.2d 1255, 1259
(Or.~1977). But when it is how a prior court would have ruled on a legal
question, the authority is reversed, and courts tend to reserve those questions
for themselves. \textit{Tinelli v.~Redl}, 199 F.3d 603, 606--07 (2d Cir.~1999);
\textit{Phillips v.~Clancy}, 733 P.2d 300, 306 (Ariz.~Ct.~App.~1986);
\textit{Thomas v.~Bethea}, 718 A.2d 1187, 1197 n.7 (Md.~1998). The reasoning of
these cases, however, is open to disagreement. The observation that ``a judge
is best suited'' to answering the question, \textit{Royal Ins.~Co.~of
Am.~v.~Miles \& Stockbridge, P.C.},~133 F.~Supp.~2d 747, 762 (D.~Md.~2001), is
not necessarily a reason for withholding it from juries, who, after all,
routinely hear difficult and complex cases. \textit{In re
U.S.~Fin.~Sec.~Litig.},~609 F.2d 411, 432 (9th Cir.~1979); \textit{see also}
\textit{Curtis v.~Loether}, 415 U.S.~189, 198 (1974) (risk of jury prejudice
``insufficient to overcome the clear command of the Seventh Amendment'');
\textit{Granfinanciera, S.A.~v.~Nordberg}, 492 U.S.~33, 63 (1989) (same for
risk of inefficiency); \textit{Hana Financial, Inc.~v.~Hana Bank}, 574
U.S.~418, 425 (2015) (same for risk that jury verdicts will be
``unpredictable''). And it is not clear that how a court \emph{would} have
acted in a counterfactual scenario is ``what the law is'' in the
\textit{Marbury} sense, \textit{see} \textit{Tinelli}, 199 F.3d at 607 (quoting
\textit{Marbury v.~Madison}, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803)), as it is purely
hypothetical (and retrospective) and cannot govern future behavior. It may be
that the tendency of courts to reserve for themselves cause-and-effect
questions about judges stems from uneasiness with the proposition that courts
are subject to ordinary cause-and-effect processes that juries can reason
about.

To assist in deciding how a prior litigation would have progressed absent the
lawyer's error, courts sometimes employ a device called the ``case within a
case'' (or ``suit within a suit''), in which the malpractice plaintiff
litigates the original case to a new judgment and the difference in outcomes is
taken to represent the plaintiff's damages. \textit{Witte v.~Desmarais}, 614
A.2d 116, 121 (N.H.~1992). The case-within-a-case collapses the distinction
between law \textit{about} the prior lawsuit and the law \textit{of} the prior
lawsuit by changing the causation question from what thee result ``would have
been'' (law-about-law) to what it ``\textit{should have} been'' (just plain
law). \textit{See} \textit{Harline v.~Barker}, 912 P.2d 433, 440 (Utah 1996)
(emphasis in original) (quoting 2 Ronald E.~Mallen \& Jeffrey M.~Smith,
\textit{Legal Malpractice} § 27.7, at 641). The former question is the usual
but-for rule from tort law, the latter a ``reflection or semblance'' of it when
the former question is difficult to answer. \textit{Lieberman v.~Employers
Ins.~of Wausau}, 419 A.2d 417, 427 (N.J.~1980).\footnote{There are other
justifications for the case-within-a-case approach, such as making the prior
judge's testimony irrelevant. \textit{Phillips}, 733 P.2d at 306.}

Mistaking the case-within-a-case for the actual causation element rather than an
approximation can lead to misleading results. In arguing that settlement of an underlying
claim should bar a subsequent malpractice suit, the Pennsylvania Bar
Associations has warned that the case-within-a-case would ``essentially a free
second bite at the apple''---allowing the plaintiff to re-roll the dice while
keeping the settlement. \textit{Khalil v.~Williams}, 53 EAL 2021 (Pa.~Aug.~3,
2021), Brief for Amici Curiae Pa.~Bar Ass'n \textit{et al.}, at 11. But that is
only true under the incorrect assumption that ``damages can only be measured
against the result the client would have obtained if the case had been tried to
a final judgment.'' \textit{Elizondo v.~Krist}, 415 S.W.3d 259, 263
(Tex.~2013); \textit{Lieberman}, 419 A.2d at 427. In a malpractice case arising
out of a settlement, a court can avoid re-rolling the dice by requiring the
client to prove that ``absent malpractice, they probably would have recovered
\emph{a settlement} for more than'' the original amount. \textit{Elizondo}, 415
S.W.3d at 270 (emphasis added). That proposition can be tested, for example, by
reference to ``settlements made under comparable circumstances.'' \textit{Id.}


\subsection{Liability Insurance}

``The holder of a liability insurance policy has a contractual right to payment
... when ... the insured's liability to a third party is within the scope of
the insurance policy.'' 7A Couch on Ins.~§~103:11 (Westlaw 2022). When the
insured has paid a third-party claimant to satisfy an alleged liability, a
question sometimes arises whether the liability satisfied was within the scope
of the insurance policy. \textit{See, e.g.}~\textit{Liberty
Mut.~Ins.~Co.~v.~Metro.~Life Ins.~Co.},~260 F.3d 54, 58--59 (1st Cir.~2001).
For example, the insured may pay to settle a lawsuit asserting multiple claims,
some covered and some not. \textit{Crosby Estate at Rancho Santa Fe Master
Ass'n v.~Ironshore Specialty Ins.~Co.}, 578 F.~Supp.~3d 1123, 1134--35 (S.D.
Cal. 2022). In such cases, the coverage question turns on law-about-law:
whether the legal basis for liability fits within the legal test for coverage.
\textit{See} \textit{id.}

It can occur that the law in effect at the time of payment differs from that in
effect at the time of indemnity. \textit{See} \textit{Cardinal v.~State}, 107
N.E.2d 569, 577 (N.Y.~1952). Even worse, the prior law may have been unsettled.
\textit{See} \textit{id.} The common-law system allows for gaps in authority.
Helena Whalen-Bridge, \textit{The Reluctant Comparativist:~Teaching Common Law
Reasoning to Civil Law Students and the Future of Comparative Legal Skills}, 58
J.~Legal Educ.~364, 367--68 (2008). A question arises whether the coverage
court should fulfill its ordinary common lawmaking function and fill the gaps.
It should not: in the law-about-law, a conclusion that liability was unsettled
at the time of payment is sufficient to resolve coverage. \textit{See}
\textit{Cardinal}, 107 N.E.2d at 578 (``That question must be answered nunc pro
tunc, not by a long-later trial, under newly handed down decisions, as to who
could be held for damages, and on what theory~...~.'').

Another issue that can arise is that an insured may justifiably settle a claim
even though it might have prevailed against the claimant at trial. \textit{See}
\textit{Luria Bros.~\& Co.~v.~Alliance Assurance Co.},~780 F.2d 1082, 1091 (2d
Cir.~1986) In that case, the insurer may argue that the payment falls outside
the policy because a \emph{liability} insurance policy requires ``actual,'' not
potential, liability. \textit{Catlin Specialty Ins.~Co.~v.~J.J.~White,
Inc.},~387 F.~Supp.~3d 583, 591 (E.D.~Pa.~2019) (Goldberg, J.). By analogy to
legal malpractice, it might seem that the insured must prove the
case-within-the-case in the coverage suit. \textit{Servidone
Const.~Corp.~v.~Security~Ins.~Co.~of Hartford}, 477 N.E.2d 441, 445
(N.Y.~1985). But courts have tended to reject that argument. \textit{Catlin},
387 F.~Supp.~3d at 590 (surveying cases). The insured need not prove that a
reasonable settlement of a covered claim was based on conduct that would have
resulted in actual liability to the underlying claimant. \textit{Id.};
\textit{see also} \textit{Chicago, R.I.~\& Pac.~Ry.~Co.~v.~United States}, 220
F.2d 939, 941 (7th Cir. 1955) (fact that party was not actually liable does not
mean it has no indemnity right for settlement). These decisions have tended to
rest on the policy ground of promoting settlement, \textit{e.g.},
\textit{Uniroyal, Inc.~v.~Home Ins.~Co.},~707 F.~Supp.~1368, 1378
(E.D.N.Y.~1988), but an argument from contract interpretation would be that a
contract insuring ``liability'' is law-about-law and thus makes the coverage
question turn on the claim against the insured and not the insured's conduct
that gave rise to the claim---a ``liability'' policy is not a ``conduct''
policy.

Perhaps the reason courts faithfully keep the distinction between law-about-law
and law-about-fact in the liability insurance context while eliding the two in
the malpractice context is that, in the malpractice context, proving actual
liability via the case-within-a-case only requires proving what the client has
maintained all along about the strength of the claim. \textit{See}
\textit{Lieberman}, 419 A.2d at 427. By contrast, asking an insured to prove a
case-within-a-case against itself would involve the insured ``turning about
face'' from contesting liability to embracing it. \textit{Uniroyal,
Inc.~v.~Home Ins.~Co.},~707 F.~Supp.~1368, 1378 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). The
awkwardness of that situation justifies only asking the insured to demonstrate
potential rather than actual liability. \textit{Id.}; \textit{see also}
\textit{Lieberman}, 419 A.2d at 427 (suggesting case-within-a-case not be used
in malpractice action where there was a ``role reversal'').

The situation becomes more confusing if coverage turns on facts neither
established nor refuted by the insured's liability. ???. For example, coverage
may depend on the date of conduct giving rise to injury. ???. But, since the
insured is not required to prove actual liability, the insured may be required
to prove the date of conduct that never occurred. ???. As a particularly
perplexing example, after deciding that asbestos manufacturer W.R.~Grace \&
Co.~could obtain indemnity for settlements to alleged customers for whom Grace
did not actually install asbestos, the court observed that, to satisfy the
coverage period, Grace was seemingly required to prove ``the date of
noninstallation,'' a question about as comprehensible as the sound of one hand
clapping. ???. As another example, a manufacturer seeking coverage for
liability to purchasers of silicone breast implants was required to prove the
\emph{date} of injury (but not the \emph{fact} of injury), even though science
conclusively established that the product caused no injury at all. ???;
\textit{see also} \textit{Catlin}. Although these bizarre counterfactuals may
be unpalatable to juries, recognizing that they are law-about-law shows them to
be the correct way of resolving the coverage dispute.


\subsection{Reverse-Payment Patent Settlements}

A final example of law-about-law comes from an area that is not usually
considered to be ``about'' legal proceedings the way malpractice and liability
insurance is: antitrust. In \textit{FTC v.~Actavis, Inc.},~570 U.S.~136 (2013),
the Supreme Court dealt with the antitrust implications of a so-called
``reverse-payment settlement'': one in which a patentholder pays an alleged
infringer not to compete. In deciding whether such a settlement could give rise
to a Sherman Act claim, the \textit{Actavis} majority and dissent disagreed
over whether a competitor could violate the antitrust laws by paying to remove
competition that might have been precluded by a valid patent had the
infringement suit proceeded to judgment. \textit{See} \textit{id.}~at 164
(dissenting opinion). In the dissent's view, if the patent were \emph{in fact}
valid and infringed, it could not be an antitrust violation to remove the
potential competition created by the cloud of uncertainty as to whether the
accused infringer might prevail at trial. \textit{See} \textit{id.}~at 164, 171.

The majority was right to reject the dissent's reasoning because it confuses
law \textit{about} the infringement litigation with the law \textit{of} the
infringement litigation. Within patent law, it is true that ``a patent is
either valid or invalid,'' no middle ground. \textit{Actavis}, 570 U.S.~at 171
(dissenting opinion). But when talking \textit{about} patent law, it is
accurate to acknowledge that a patent ``may or may not be valid.''
\textit{Id.}~at 147 (majority opinion). If a cloud of uncertainty regarding the
outcome of an infringement trial might spur the patentholder to ``permit[] the
patent challenger to enter the market before the patent expires,'' it violates
the antitrust laws to pay to remove that competition. \textit{See}
\textit{id.}~at 154.

Although legal malpractice and liability insurance are about prior legal
proceedings and therefore inherently law-about-law, the same justification does
not hold for antitrust law, which is about ``trade.'' \textit{See} 15
U.S.C.~§~1. The \textit{Actavis} majority reasoned that the Sherman Act should
take account of uncertainty in patent law because Congress would have wanted to
put antitrust policy on par with patent policy in reconciling the two statutes.
570 U.S.~at 137. A possible textual justification for doing so is that the word
``trade'' in the Sherman Act includes trade in property rights and therefore
refers also to the legal proceedings that enforce those property rights. Thus,
the Sherman Act can be considered textually law-about-law.

There is an exceedingly close parallel between \textit{Actavis} and the
insurer--insured scenario discussed above. In both, the actor under scrutiny
negotiates its liability to one party while simultaneously holding a duty to
protect certain interests of a third party in the outcome of that negotiation.
In the insurer--insured context, the insured negotiates its liability to the
claimant while owing a duty to the insurer not to pay unreasonably or in bad
faith. \textit{Uniroyal}, 707 F.~Supp.~at 1379. In an \emph{Actavis} situation,
the alleged infringer negotiates its liability to the patentholder while owing
a duty to the consuming public not to unreasonably restrain trade. In both,
whether the negotiating party satisfies that duty is measured by its
\emph{potential} exposure rather than by litigating the case-within-a-case.
\textit{Luria}, 780 F.2d at 1091--92; \textit{Actavis}, 570 U.S.~at 157 (``[I]t
is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust
question ... .''). The following statements are therefore analogous:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A liability insurer cannot avoid payment merely by showing that the
    insured would have prevailed against the underlying claimant.
    \textit{Luria}, 780 F.2d at 1091--92.
  \item An \textit{Actavis} defendant cannot avoid antitrust liability merely
    by showing that the patent was valid and infringed. \textit{See}
    \textit{Actavis}, 570 U.S.~at 147 (fact that ``the agreement's
    `anticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclusionary
    potential of the patent' ... [does not] immunize the agreement from
    antitrust attack'').
\end{enumerate}

The \textit{Actavis} dissent observed there was 'no suggestion' that
collaterally attack etc. ???. Taking the analogy from liability insurance,
there is a good reason why not: in defending such a suit, the accused infringer
would have to ``turn about face'' from contesting infringement, to embracing
it, ``markedly reduc[ing] the advantages ... of settling.'' \textit{Uniroyal},
707 F.~Supp.~at 1378.


\section{Conclusion}

These are just three examples of law-about-law, but there are many more:
whether law was clearly established for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) or 42
U.S.C. § 1983, ???, whether an officer committed a ``reasonable mistake of
law'' under the Fourth Amendment, ???, whether a statute is ambiguous and an
agency's interpretation of it ``reasonable,'' ???, whether a seller
misrepresented the zoning status of a property, ???, among others. Given the
close parallels illustrated between the three examples set out above---in
particular the almost perfect analogy between liability insurance and antitrust
law---it is likely that the same principles would govern other areas where the
law talks about law, and that these examples should be looked to for guidance.
