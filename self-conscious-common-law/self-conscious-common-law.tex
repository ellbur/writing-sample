\vspace{12pt}\section{Introduction}

Statements about statements (``higher-order statements'') have long bothered
logicians, \textit{see} W.V.~Quine, \textit{Philosophy of Logic} 66--68 (2d
ed.~1986), so it is not surprising that they would make trouble for judges as
well. But law-about-law is not just a theoretical curiosity. Everyday examples
include: Was law X \emph{clearly established}? Did lawyer Y \emph{misrepresent}
law X? Would court Z have \emph{accepted} law X had the issue been raised?
Untangling these questions matters to judges who must decide whether to submit
such ``legal facts'' to juries. And, as shown below, the way law ``talks about
law'' can affect the substance of legal rights.

This essay surveys how courts deal with law-about-law in three discrete and
seemingly unrelated areas. The purpose is to demonstrate that all three are
variations of the same underlying theme---namely, how law talks about itself.


\section{Discussion}

Three examples of law-about-law are discussed below: legal malpractice,
liability insurance, and the ``reverse-payment'' antitrust claim recognized
in \textit{FTC v.~Actavis}, ???.


\subsection{Legal Malpractice}

In a legal malpractice case arising out of litigation, the former client
accuses the lawyer of having litigated the case incorrectly. To prove
causation, the plaintiff must show that, had the lawyer acted correctly, the
outcome would have been more favorable. \textit{Bozelko v.~Papastavros}, 147
A.3d 1023, 1029 (Conn.~2016). The causation element is therefore law-about-law:
how would another court have behaved differently if presented with the correct
litigation strategy? \textit{See} \textit{id.}

This law-about-law element creates several issues. The first is whether a judge
or jury should decide it. If the question is how a prior factfinder (judge or
jury) would have acted on different evidence, there is general agreement to
send that question to a jury. \textit{Chocktoot v.~Smith}, 571 P.2d 1255, 1259
(Or.~1977). But when it is how a prior court would have ruled on a legal
question, the authority is reversed, and courts tend to reserve those questions
for themselves. \textit{Tinelli v.~Redl}, 199 F.3d 603, 606--07 (2d Cir.~1999);
\textit{Phillips v.~Clancy}, 733 P.2d 300, 306 (Ariz.~Ct.~App.~1986);
\textit{Thomas v.~Bethea}, 718 A.2d 1187, 1197 n.7 (Md.~1998). The reasoning of
these cases, however, is open to disagreement. The observation that ``a judge
is best suited'' to answering the question, \textit{Royal Ins.~Co.~of
Am.~v.~Miles \& Stockbridge, P.C.},~133 F.~Supp.~2d 747, 762 (D.~Md.~2001), is
not necessarily a reason for withholding it from juries, who, after all,
routinely hear difficult and complex cases. \textit{In re
U.S.~Fin.~Sec.~Litig.},~609 F.2d 411, 432 (9th Cir.~1979); \textit{see also}
\textit{Curtis v.~Loether}, 415 U.S.~189, 198 (1974) (risk of jury prejudice
``insufficient to overcome the clear command of the Seventh Amendment'');
\textit{Granfinanciera, S.A.~v.~Nordberg}, 492 U.S.~33, 63 (1989) (same for
risk of inefficiency); \textit{Hana Financial, Inc.~v.~Hana Bank}, 574
U.S.~418, 425 (2015) (same for risk that jury verdicts will be
``unpredictable''). And it is not clear that how a court \emph{would} have
acted in a counterfactual scenario is ``what the law is'' in the
\textit{Marbury} sense, \textit{see} \textit{Tinelli}, 199 F.3d at 607 (quoting
\textit{Marbury v.~Madison}, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803)), as it is purely
hypothetical (and retrospective) and cannot govern future behavior. It may be
that the tendency of courts to reserve for themselves cause-and-effect
questions about judges stems from uneasiness with the proposition that courts
are subject to ordinary cause-and-effect processes that juries can reason
about.

To assist in deciding how a prior litigation would have progressed absent
the lawyer's error, courts sometimes employ a device called the ``case within a case'' (or
``suit within a suit''), in which the malpractice plaintiff litigates the
original case to a new judgment and the difference in outcomes is taken to
represent the plaintiff's damages. \textit{Witte v.~Desmarais}, 614 A.2d 116,
121 (N.H.~1992). The case-within-a-case collapses the distinction between
law-about-law and just plain law by changing the causation question from what
thee result ``would have been'' (law-about-law) to what it ``\textit{should
have} been'' (just plain law). \textit{See} \textit{Harline v.~Barker}, 912
P.2d 433, 440 (Utah 1996) (emphasis in original) (quoting 2 Ronald E.~Mallen \&
Jeffrey M.~Smith, \textit{Legal Malpractice} § 27.7, at 641). The former
question is the usual but-for rule from tort law, the latter a ``reflection or
semblance'' of it when the former question is difficult to answer. 
\textit{Lieberman v.~Employers Ins.~of Wausau}, 419 A.2d 417, 427
(N.J.~1980).\footnote{There are other justifications for the case-within-a-case
approach, such as making the prior judge's testimony irrelevant.
\textit{Phillips}, 733 P.2d at 306.}

Mistaking the case-within-a-case for the actual causation element rather than an
approximation can lead to misleading results. In arguing that settlement of an underlying
claim should bar a subsequent malpractice suit, the Pennsylvania Bar
Associations has warned that the case-within-a-case would ``essentially a free
second bite at the apple''---allowing the plaintiff to re-roll the dice while
keeping the settlement. \textit{Khalil v.~Williams}, 53 EAL 2021 (Pa.~Aug.~3,
2021), Brief for Amici Curiae Pa.~Bar Ass'n \textit{et al.}, at 11. But that is
only true under the incorrect assumption that ``damages can only be measured
against the result the client would have obtained if the case had been tried to
a final judgment.'' \textit{Elizondo v.~Krist}, 415 S.W.3d 259, 263
(Tex.~2013); \textit{Lieberman}, 419 A.2d at 427. In a malpractice case arising
out of a settlement, a court can avoid re-rolling the dice by requiring the
client to prove that ``absent malpractice, they probably would have recovered
\emph{a settlement} for more than'' the original amount. \textit{Elizondo}, 415
S.W.3d at 270 (emphasis added). That proposition can be tested, for example, by
reference to ``settlements made under comparable circumstances.'' \textit{Id.}


\subsection{Liability Insurance}

A liability insurance policy gives the insured a right to indemnity for
payments made to satisfy certain kinds of liability of the insured to third
parties. ???. After the insured has paid, a question sometimes arises whether
the liability was covered. ???. For example, the insured may pay to settle a
lawsuit asserting multiple claims, some covered and some not. ???. In such
cases, the coverage question turns on law-about-law: whether the legal basis
for liability fits within the legal test for coverage.

It can occur that the law in effect at the time of payment differs from that in
effect at the time of indemnity. ???. Even worse, the prior law may have been
unsettled. ???. The common-law system allows gaps in authority---in fact, those
`gaps \emph{are} the law' because they represent the extension of old authority
to new facts. ???. A question arises whether the coverage court should fulfill
its ordinary common lawmaking function and fill the gaps. It should not: in the
law-about-law, a conclusion that liability was unsettled at the time of payment
is sufficient to resolve coverage. ???.

Another issue that can arise is that an insured may justifiably settle a claim
even though it could have prevailed against the claimant at trial. ???. In that
case, the insurer will argue that the payment falls outside the policy because
a \emph{liability} insurance policy requires \emph{liability}. ???. By analogy
to legal malpractice, it might seem that the insured must prove the
case-within-the-case in the coverage suit. But courts have tended to reject
that argument. ???. The key is to observe that coverage is a question of
law-about-law and thus depends on the characterization of the \emph{claim}, not
of the insured's underlying conduct that gave rise to the claim---it is a
liability policy, not a conduct policy. With that understanding, the insured
need not prove that a reasonable settlement of a covered claim was based on
conduct that would have resulted in actual liability to the underlying
claimant. ???.

Perhaps the reason courts faithfully keep the distinction between
law-about-law and law-about-fact in the liability insurance context while
eliding the two in the malpractice context is that, in the malpractice context,
proving the case-within-a-case only requires proving what the client has
maintained all along about the strength of the claim. \textit{See}
\textit{Lieberman}, 419 A.2d at 427. By contrast, asking an insured to prove
the case-within-a-case would involve the insured making an about-face from
contesting liability to embracing it. ???. The awkwardness of that situation
justifies only asking the insured to demonstrate potential rather than actual
liability. ???; \textit{see also} \textit{Lieberman}, 419 A.2d at 427
(suggesting case-within-a-case not be used in malpractice action where there
was a ``role reversal'').

The situation becomes more confusing if coverage turns on facts neither
established nor refuted by the insured's liability. ???. For example, coverage
may depend on the date of conduct giving rise to injury. ???. But, since the
insured is not required to prove actual liability, the insured may be required
to prove the date of conduct that never occurred. ???. As a particularly
perplexing example, after deciding that asbestos manufacturer W.R.~Grace \&
Co.~could obtain indemnity for settlements to alleged customers for whom Grace
did not actually install asbestos, the court observed that, to satisfy the
coverage period, Grace was seemingly required to prove ``the date of
noninstallation,'' a question about as comprehensible as the sound of one hand
clapping. ???. As another example, a manufacturer seeking coverage for
liability to purchasers of silicone breast implants was required to prove the
\emph{date} of injury (but not the \emph{fact} of injury), even though science
conclusively established that the product caused no injury at all. ???;
\textit{see also} \textit{Catlin}.

Although these bizarre counterfactuals may be unpalatable to juries,
acknowledging that coverage under a liability policy is a question of
law-about-law shows that ??? and ??? were correct in their approach to deciding
coverage.


\subsection{Reverse-Payment Patent Settlements}

In \textit{FTC v.~Actavis ???}, ???, the Supreme Court dealt with the antitrust
implications of a so-called ``reverse-payment settlement'': one in which a
patentholder pays an alleged infringer not to compete. In deciding whether such
a settlement could give rise to a Sherman Act claim, the \textit{Actavis}
majority and dissent disagreed over whether a competitor could violate the
antitrust laws by paying to remove competition that might have been precluded
by a valid patent had the infringement suit proceeded to judgment. ???. In the
dissent's view, if the patent were \emph{in fact} valid and infringed, it could
not be an antitrust violation to remove the potential competition created by
the cloud of uncertainty as to whether the accused infringer might prevail at
trial. ???.

The error in the dissent's reasoning, and the reason the majority was right to
reject it, is that it confuses law-about-law with regular law. \textit{Within}
patent law, it is true that `every patent is either valid or not, no middle
ground.' But when talking \textit{about} patent law, it is possible to have a
patent of unknown validity. ???. If a cloud of uncertainty regarding the
outcome of an infringement trial would spur the patentholder to allow
competition, it violates the antitrust laws to pay to remove it. ???.

That still leaves the question of why the Sherman Act is law-about-law. In
legal malpractice and liability insurance, there is an obvious justification as
both are about prior legal proceedings. The \textit{Actavis} majority is
probably correct that the real reason the Sherman Act should be treated
similarly is because that is what Congress would have wanted. \textit{See} ???.
A theoretical justification may be that the word ``trade'' in the Sherman Act,
\textit{e.g.}~15 U.S.C.~§~1, refers to a trade in property rights and therefore
references, by implication, the legal proceedings that enforce those property
rights. And it does some from the outside, accepting any uncertainty that
such proceedings may entail. \textit{See} ???.

There is a strangely close parallel between \textit{Actavis} and the
insurer--insured scenario discussed above. In both, the actor under scrutiny
negotiates its liability to one party while simultaneously holding a duty to
protect certain interests of a third party in the outcome of that negotiation.
In the insurer--insured context, the insured negotiates its liability to the
claimant while owing a duty to the insurer not to pay in bad faith. ???. In an
\emph{Actavis} situation, the alleged infringer negotiates its liability to the
patentholder while owing a duty to the consuming public not to unreasonably
restrain trade. ???. In both, whether the negotiating party satisfies that duty
is measured by its \emph{potential} exposure rather than by litigating the
case-within-a-case and seeing whether liability would have been found at trial.
The following statements are therefore analogues:

\vspace{18pt}%
{%
  \setstretch{1.0}%
  \setlength\extrarowheight{3pt}%
  \noindent\begin{tabular}{p{3in}|p{3in}}
  \textbf{Liability Insurance} & \textbf{\textit{Actavis}} \\[3pt] \hline
  {The insurer cannot avoid payment merely by showing that the insured
  would have prevailed against the underlying claimant.} &
  {An \textit{Actavis} plaintiff cannot show that an alleged infringer wrongfully
  settled merely because the infringement suit would have failed.} \\[3pt] \hline
  {The insured cannot obtain reimbursement for an unreasonable settlement merely by showing
  it would have lost at trial.} &
  {An \textit{Actavis} defendant cannot avoid
  antitrust liability merely by showing that the patent was valid and infringed.}
\end{tabular}}\vspace{18pt}

Interestingly, even the \textit{Actavis} dissent seemed to acknowledge that an
antitrust plaintiff could not prevail by collaterally attacking the patent's
\textit{actual} validity. ???. Taking the analogy from the liability insurance
context, there is a good reason for not letting an antitrust plaintiff rely on
the ultimate success or failure of the infringement suit (instead, as the
\textit{Actavis} majority allowed, limiting the antitrust plaintiff to showing
the parties' \textit{anticipation} of success): lawsuits would never settle if
settlement did not create finality. ???


\section{Conclusion}

These are just three examples of law-about-law, but there are many more:
whether law was clearly established for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) or 42
U.S.C. § 1983, ???, whether an officer committed a ``reasonable mistake of
law'' under the Fourth Amendment, ???, whether a statute is ambiguous and an
agency's interpretation of it ``reasonable,'' ???, whether a seller
misrepresented the zoning status of a property, ???, among others.
